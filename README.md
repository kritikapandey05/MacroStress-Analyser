## üë• Target Audience

- Students applying to finance, quant, or trading roles (e.g., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs)
- Aspiring macro analysts or researchers
- Curious learners exploring macro + markets

## üìà Data Sources

- **FRED API:** Fed Funds Rate, CPI, Yield Curves
- **Yahoo Finance (via yfinance):** ETF price data

---

## üßÆ How the Calculations Work

### 1. ETF Price Normalization

We use daily adjusted close prices for each ETF (e.g., SPY, XLK, etc.) fetched from Yahoo Finance via yfinance.

To normalize ETF prices over a macro period:
```
normalized_price = (price_series / price_series.iloc) * 100
```
This sets the starting value to 100 so you can easily compare relative growth or decline.

---

### 2. Portfolio Value Calculation

Users input percentage weights for selected ETFs. The weighted portfolio is calculated as follows:
```
alloc = np.array([weights[etf] / 100 for etf in selected])
df_norm["Portfolio"] = df_norm[selected].dot(alloc)
```
Here, `df_norm` contains normalized prices for selected ETFs and `.dot()` performs a matrix multiplication of ETF prices with the weights.

---

### 3. Return, Volatility, and Max Drawdown

- **Total Return (%):**
```
total_return = normalized_portfolio.iloc[-1] - 100
```
- **Volatility (Annualized):**
```
volatility = daily_returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)
```
- **Max Drawdown (%):**
```
drawdown = (portfolio / portfolio.cummax() - 1).min() * 100
```
---

### 4. CPI Inflation YoY %

We use CPI Index from FRED and calculate year-over-year percentage change:
```
cpi_yoy = (cpi.pct_change(12) * 100).dropna()
```
---

### 5. Yield Curve Spread

We fetch GS10 (10Y Treasury) and DTB3 (3M Treasury) from FRED and compute the spread:
```
yield_spread = gs10 - dtb3
```
If the spread goes below 0, it‚Äôs called a yield curve inversion, which historically precedes U.S. recessions. The app shows a warning when this happens.

---

### 6. Sector Heatmap Across Shocks

We calculate percent return per ETF per macro scenario:
```
sector_return = (end_price / start_price - 1) * 100
```
Applied to each ETF (e.g., XLK, XLF, etc.), mapped to sectors and plotted with a heatmap. Includes an "Average" row across scenarios.
